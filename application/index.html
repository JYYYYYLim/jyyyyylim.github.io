      theres a lot more, but I've explained why they aren't included in my application.

        another one I really wanted to include was my design of a slimeblock elevator back around mcpe 0.15, but as stated above I didn't include it. design's fairly similar to other slimeblock elevator designs though, albeit slightly less compact. I'm sure it could be improved more if I put in more effort into that.
